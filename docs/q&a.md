# Q & A

### Does this plugin support Multiplayer?

Yes. SAS was designed to work efficiently in multiplayer from the start.

### Why another ability system?

There are already existing solutions for abilities. Why create another one?

One may, very reasonably, wonder why use SAS instead of, for example, **Gameplay Ability System** **(GAS)**. Ability systems are not a new problem, and there are solutions out there already.

When **SAS** was designed, we looked at present and past solutions, saw what worked and what didn't, and then iterated over it.

However, we do this under an specific development philosophy. **SAS** focuses on empowering the developer, and this includes non-technical roles. Our biggest objective is to reduce the amount of work, mental effort and time spent by the developer while creating content, debugging bugs or implementing new features. See [Design Principles](resources/design-principles.md).

### Why not GAS?

**GAS** is a well known and powerful ability system published by Epic Games that introduced many good features like prediction or the use of Gameplay Tags.

Apart from those mentioned before, one of the reasons why we created **Splash Abilities System** is because we needed high iteration times and accessible creation of content.

SAS is primarily, easy to work with. We cannot sacrifice development time and risk introducing bugs due to complexity. That's why SAS is:

- Lightweight
- Simple
- Accessible: Fully supports Blueprints
- Flexible & Customizable
- Easy to work with
