# Design Principles

## Simplicity

> *The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak.*  
> **Hans Hofmann**

**SAS** is built avoiding unneccesary complexity. This is applied everywhere around the world, not only in code. Good design is often built on iteration around a simple idea. Complex ideas fail too often, take too much time and give too many problems.

## Reusability

**SAS** is designed to work on many games without compromising features. It is not the ability system for a particular game. It is a set of tools and helpers that allows a game to build its own abilities system.

## Modularity

Many concepts are built as modules that can be customized and expanded. Provides flexibility and gives control to the developer using the plugin.

## UX: Who is the user of the feature?

Sometimes we forget the fact that tools should empower the people that use them. They should make work easier and quicker. Therefore, it is fundamental to consider how long is the path to achieve something by the developer.
*How much mental effort, how many clicks, how many screens.*
