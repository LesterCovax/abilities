Splash Damage's **Ability System** (**SAS**) is an **Unreal Engine 4** plugin that provides lightweight, intuitive and efficient abilities.

**SAS** is designed to provide developers flexibility and better quality of life while building content for their games. It **empowers developers** to create games with complex ability designs with the minimum amount of work.

The uses of SAS can be broad. It is **not** designed to suit a particular genre. However it will, at least conceptually, fit better in genres like FPS, RPGs, Combat, Stealth, RTS, etc.

## Requirements

- Unreal Engine 4.25.1 or newer
- [Automatron](https://github.com/splash-damage/Automatron) plugin for automated testing
